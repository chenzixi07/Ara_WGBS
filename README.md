bsmap2cx.pl: convert the bsmap-format result provided by GSE54292 to CX-report (_Analysis of publicly available data_ in our manuscript).

BisSNP.call.sh: call SNPs from WGBS data (_Identification of SNPs in MA samples_ in our manuscript).

BisSNP.filter.sh: filter SNPs from WGBS data (_Identification of SNPs in MA samples_ in our manuscript).
